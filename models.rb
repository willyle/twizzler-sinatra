# When using Active Record, our program makes some assumptions 
# about our database.
# 
# Model class names are singular. 
# The singular model name refers to pluralized table name:
#
#    - "Users" model refers to "users" table
#    - "Relationship" model refers to "relationships" table
#    - "Twizzle" model refers to "twizzles" table
#    - "Group" model refers to "groups" table
#    - "UserGroup" model refers to "user_groups" table

# If the class name includes multiple words that begin with
# capital letters, the words will be separated by underscores 
# in the table name.
#
# Active Record also assumes that each table has an automatically 
# incremented integer primary key column named id.

# The User class below gives us the ability to track many-to-many
# associations between users through one "relationships" table. 
#
# Unlike symmetric Facebook-style friendships, 
# which are always reciprocal (at least at the data-model level), 
# Twitter-style following relationships are potentially asymmetric.
# Calvin can follow Hobbes without Hobbes following Calvin. 
# To distinguish between these two cases, weâ€™ll adopt the terminology of 
# active and passive relationships: if Calvin is following Hobbes 
# but not vice versa, Calvin has an active relationship with Hobbes and 
# Hobbes has a passive relationship with Calvin.
# 
# We accomplish this by referring to two columns in the "relationships"
# table called "follower_id" and "following_id". We are specifying that 
# these are the forgein keys used to differentiate between active and 
# passive relationships.

# The has_many :through construct refers to an association, not a table. 
# The :source is a relationship in the class that that association refers to.
